 Follow the documentation in the official Cloudsuite Media Straming Page to setup the Media Streaming client, Media Streaming server and Dataset containers
    	"http://cloudsuite.ch//pages/benchmarks/mediastreaming/"
 
 1. To run these containers on different instances, you need to change the network configuration to 'host' network instead of using docker network as below
         $ docker run -d --name streaming_server --volumes-from streaming_dataset --net=host cloudsuite/media-streaming:server
 
 2. After the Docker containers  are setup, Run the shell script "turn_off_cores.sh" to turn off the additional cores in x86 Server Instance to keep the cores configuration consistent with ARM Server Instance
   		$ ./turn_off_cores.sh
 
 3. Check the active cores on the instances using the below command to verify the configuration, it should show only 8 active cores for both x86 Server Instance and ARM Server Instance
		$ lscpu
 
 4. Now to run the benchmark media streaming client container needs to be run, this script might have to be run several times to get consistent values.
 
 5. Collect the results from the console and use the 'MediaStreaming-LogsParser.py' script to parse the logs and  get the (Total Connections, Total Errors, Percentage Failure) information. These values can be used to generate the plots.

 6. To run the benchmark in Total Connections range of your choice, use the script 'launch_hunt_bin.sh' provided here, replace the script in Media Streaming client and rebuild the container.

 7. To vary the range of total connections, modify (lowLimSessions,hiLimSessions) in the script.
