 Follow the documentation in the official Cloudsuite Data Caching Page to setup the Datacaching client and Datacaching server containers.
    	"http://cloudsuite.ch//pages/benchmarks/datacaching/"

1. To run these containers on different instances, you need to change the network configuration to 'host' network instead of using docker network as below:
 		$ docker run --name dc-server --net=host -d cloudsuite/data-caching:server -t 4 -m 4096 -n 550
 
 2. After the Docker containers for x86 Datacaching Client, x86 Datacaching Server and ARM Datacaching Server are setup, run the shell scrupt 'turn_off_cores.sh' to turn off the additional cores in x86 Server Instance to keep the cores configuration consistent with ARM Instance:
   		$ ./turn_off_cores.sh
 
 3. Check the active cores on the instances using the below command to verify the configuration, it should show only 8 active cores for both x86 Server Instance and ARM Server Instance:
		$ lscpu
 
 4. At this point all the docker containers are setup and warm up of the server is done using the client.
 
 5. Now to run the benchmark in the RPS range of [10000, 200000] place the 'run_script.sh' inside the x86 Datacaching client Container in the follow path '/usr/src/memcached/memcached_client/' and run the script to perform the benchmark.
 
 6. This script might have to be run several times to get consistent values.
 
 7. Collect the results from the console and use the 'DataCaching-LogsParser.py' script to parse the logs and  get the (RPS, Average Latency, 95th Percentile) information at each RPS value. These values can be used to generate the plots.
